Useful documentation :
* The paper presenting the data we are using as a reference is : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.5896.pdf. The introduction and what relates to Figure 20 is whatâ€™s of interest to us in priority.

* The paper presenting the non linear model we are planning to test is : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.04519.pdf. Sections 1, 2 and 6 specifically (+ appendix).
